# Example

---
 Pima Indian Diabetes dataset 
 
- PREG: number of times pregnant (low/high)

- GLUC: plasma glucose concentration (low/high)

- PRES: diastolic blood pressure (low/high)

- TRIC: triceps skin fold thickness (low/high)

- INS: 2-hour serum insulin (low/high)

- MASS: body mass index (low/high)

- PED: diabetes pedigree function (low/high)

- AGE: age (low/high)

- DIAB: test for diabetes (neg/pos)

392 observations

- We chose this dataset as it best showcases our monitors. However, we acknowledge that we are using the data in this capacity without compensating the original Akimel O’odham participants. 
The isolation imposed by the political boundaries of this isolation created a useful dataset at the expense of the liberty of the Akimel O’odham. 

???
We chose this dataset after running many examples because we think it best showcases how our monitors can check the structure of a Bayes Net.

options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)

library("bnmonitor")
library("bnlearn")
library("qgraph")
library("ggplot2")

load("diabetes.RData")

# Robustness

---
``` {r glb}
global_monitor(dag = dag , df = diabetes,alpha=2)
```

- $\alpha$ is commonly set as the maximum number of levels for a node in the dataset

???
global monitors are used to compare moodels

# Prequential Monitors

\citet{Dawid1992} and were developed in \citet{Cowell2006,Cowell2007}
- $p_i$ gives the predictive density of the BN learned using the dataset $x_{[i-1]}$ including only the first $i-1$-th observations

- the level of surprise of observing the value $y_j\in\mathbb{Y}_j$ for the $j$-th variable after having processed $i$ observations is:  
$$S_{ij} = -\log(p_i(y_j)))$$

- We use the logarithmic score function here, but other score functions can certainly be used. 

---
# Standardization

- Relative standardization compares the log likelihood contributions to two different models. 

- Absolute standardization computes a Z-statistic using the following expectation and variance

- $$E_{ij} = \sum_{y_j\in\mathbb{Y}_j}p_i(y_j)\log(p_i(y_j))$$

- $$V_{ij}=\sum_{y_j\in\mathbb{Y}_j}p_i(y_j)\log(p_i(y_j))^2-E_{ij}^2$$

- $$Z_{ij}=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^iS_{kj}-\sum_{k=1}^iE_{kj}}{\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^i}V_{kj}}$$

- values of and  $| Z_{ij}|> 1.96$ in absolute value may be an indication of poor model fit

---
# Marginal node monitors 

- Marginal and conditional node monitors check the appropriateness of the probability distributions of each node

``` {r node good fit,warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
marg.ped <- plot(seq_marg_monitor(dag, diabetes, "PED"))
marg.ped + geom_hline(yintercept = 1.96, linetype='dashed', col = 'red') +  geom_hline(yintercept = -1.96, linetype='dashed', col = 'red')
```

- The marginal node monitor for PED (diabetes pedigree function) indicates a good fit.

???
Node monitors are used to assess the accuracty of forecasts.
We are most often concerned about this with the 'final outcome' nodes. 
Here the pedigree of diabetes suggests that the forecasts flowing from the model are accurate.
---
# Marginal node monitors 

``` {r node bad fit, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
marg.diab <- plot(seq_marg_monitor(dag, diabetes, "DIAB"))
marg.diab + geom_hline(yintercept = 1.96, linetype='dashed', col = 'red') +  geom_hline(yintercept = -1.96, linetype='dashed', col = 'red')
```

- The marginal node monitor for DIAB (diabetes) suggests that the the marginal distribution may be inappropriate for later forecasts.

???
By contrast, the marginal sequential node monitor suggests that the probability distribution for the node  diabetes is not necessarily accurate for later observation in the data. 

---
# Conditional node monitors 

``` {r cond monitor, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
cond.preg <- plot(seq_cond_monitor(dag, diabetes, "PREG"))#some weird issues 
cond.preg + geom_hline(yintercept = 1.96, linetype='dashed', col = 'red') +  geom_hline(yintercept = -1.96, linetype='dashed', col = 'red')
```

- The conditional node monitor for PREG (pregnancy) indicates a poor fit to early forecasts in the data. 

---
# Parent child monitor


```{r pach monitor,warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
plot(seq_pa_ch_monitor(dag , diabetes , "PREG",pa.names = "AGE", pa.val = "low",alpha=2))+ geom_hline(yintercept = 1.96, linetype='dashed', col = 'red') +  geom_hline(yintercept = -1.96, linetype='dashed', col = 'red')
```

??? 
We can further probe this with the parent child monitor. 
We check all possible values of the parent nodes and find that young women in particular are difficult to predict pregnancies for.

# Hello World

Install the **xaringan** package from [Github](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan):

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("yihui/xaringan")
```

You are recommended to use the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), but you do not have to.

- Create a new R Markdown document from the menu `File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> Ninja Presentation`;<sup>1</sup>

--

- Click the `Knit` button to compile it;

--

- or use the [RStudio Addin](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/)<sup>2</sup> "Infinite Moon Reader" to live preview the slides (every time you update and save the Rmd document, the slides will be automatically reloaded in RStudio Viewer.

# Hello Ninja

As a presentation ninja, you certainly should not be satisfied by the "Hello World" example. You need to understand more about two things:

1. The [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com) library;

1. The **xaringan** package;

Basically **xaringan** injected the chakra of R Markdown (minus Pandoc) into **remark.js**. The slides are rendered by remark.js in the web browser, and the Markdown source needed by remark.js is generated from R Markdown (**knitr**).

---

# remark.js

You can see an introduction of remark.js from [its homepage](https://remarkjs.com). You should read the [remark.js Wiki](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki) at least once to know how to

- create a new slide (Markdown syntax<sup>*</sup> and slide properties);

- format a slide (e.g. text alignment);

- configure the slideshow;

- and use the presentation (keyboard shortcuts).

It is important to be familiar with remark.js before you can understand the options in **xaringan**.

.footnote[[*] It is different with Pandoc's Markdown! It is limited but should be enough for presentation purposes. Come on... You do not need a slide for the Table of Contents! Well, the Markdown support in remark.js [may be improved](https://github.com/gnab/remark/issues/142) in the future.]

# Using xaringan

---

# xaringan

Provides an R Markdown output format `xaringan::moon_reader` as a wrapper for remark.js, and you can use it in the YAML metadata, e.g.

```yaml
---
title: "A Cool Presentation"
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    yolo: true
    nature:
      autoplay: 30000
---
```

See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for all possible options that you can use.

# remark.js vs xaringan

Some differences between using remark.js (left) and using **xaringan** (right):

.pull-left[
1. Start with a boilerplate HTML file;

1. Plain Markdown;

1. Write JavaScript to autoplay slides;

1. Manually configure MathJax;

1. Highlight code with `*`;

1. Edit Markdown source and refresh browser to see updated slides;
]

.pull-right[
1. Start with an R Markdown document;

1. R Markdown (can embed R/other code chunks);

1. Provide an option `autoplay`;

1. MathJax just works;<sup>*</sup>

1. Highlight code with `{{}}`;

1. The RStudio addin "Infinite Moon Reader" automatically refreshes slides on changes;
]

.footnote[[*] Not really. See next page.]

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# R Code

```{r comment='#'}
# a boring regression
fit = lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)
coef(summary(fit))
dojutsu = c('地爆天星', '天照', '加具土命', '神威', '須佐能乎', '無限月読')
grep('天', dojutsu, value = TRUE)
```

---

# R Plots

```{r cars, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19, col = 'darkgray', las = 1)
abline(fit, lwd = 2)
```

---

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = 'html')
```

---

# HTML Widgets

I have not thoroughly tested HTML widgets against **xaringan**. Some may work well, and some may not. It is a little tricky.

Similarly, the Shiny mode (`runtime: shiny`) does not work. I might get these issues fixed in the future, but these are not of high priority to me. I never turn my presentation into a Shiny app. When I need to demonstrate more complicated examples, I just launch them separately. It is convenient to share slides with other people when they are plain HTML/JS applications.

See the next page for two HTML widgets.

```{r out.width='100%', fig.height=6, eval=require('leaflet')}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(-93.65, 42.0285, zoom = 17)
```

---

```{r eval=require('DT'), tidy=FALSE}
DT::datatable(
  head(iris, 10),
  fillContainer = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 8)
)
```

---

# Some Tips

- Do not forget to try the `yolo` option of `xaringan::moon_reader`.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        yolo: true
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- Slides can be automatically played if you set the `autoplay` option under `nature`, e.g. go to the next slide every 30 seconds in a lightning talk:

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          autoplay: 30000
    ```

- If you want to restart the play after it reaches the last slide, you may set the sub-option `loop` to TRUE, e.g.,

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          autoplay:
            interval: 30000
            loop: true
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- A countdown timer can be added to every page of the slides using the `countdown` option under `nature`, e.g. if you want to spend one minute on every page when you give the talk, you can set:

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          countdown: 60000
    ```

    Then you will see a timer counting down from `01:00`, to `00:59`, `00:58`, ... When the time is out, the timer will continue but the time turns red.
    
---

# Some Tips

- The title slide is created automatically by **xaringan**, but it is just another remark.js slide added before your other slides.

    The title slide is set to `class: center, middle, inverse, title-slide` by default. You can change the classes applied to the title slide with the `titleSlideClass` option of `nature` (`title-slide` is always applied).

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          titleSlideClass: [top, left, inverse]
    ```
    
--

- If you'd like to create your own title slide, disable **xaringan**'s title slide with the `seal = FALSE` option of `moon_reader`.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        seal: false
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- There are several ways to build incremental slides. See [this presentation](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/incremental.html) for examples.

- The option `highlightLines: true` of `nature` will highlight code lines that start with `*`, or are wrapped in `{{ }}`, or have trailing comments `#<<`;

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          highlightLines: true
    ```

    See examples on the next page.

---

# Some Tips


.pull-left[
An example using a leading `*`:

    ```r
    if (TRUE) {
    ** message("Very important!")
    }
    ```
Output:
```r
if (TRUE) {
* message("Very important!")
}
```

This is invalid R code, so it is a plain fenced code block that is not executed.
]

.pull-right[
An example using `{{}}`:

````
`r ''````{r tidy=FALSE}
if (TRUE) {
*{{ message("Very important!") }}
}
```
````
Output:
```{r tidy=FALSE}
if (TRUE) {
{{ message("Very important!") }}
}
```

It is valid R code so you can run it. Note that `{{}}` can wrap an R expression of multiple lines.
]

---

# Some Tips

An example of using the trailing comment `#<<` to highlight lines:

````markdown
`r ''````{r tidy=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +   #<<
  geom_smooth()    #<<
```
````

Output:

```{r tidy=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +   #<<
  geom_smooth()    #<<
```

---

# Some Tips

When you enable line-highlighting, you can also use the chunk option `highlight.output` to highlight specific lines of the text output from a code chunk. For example, `highlight.output = TRUE` means highlighting all lines, and `highlight.output = c(1, 3)` means highlighting the first and third line.

````md
`r ''````{r, highlight.output=c(1, 3)}
head(iris)
```
````

```{r, highlight.output=c(1, 3), echo=FALSE}
head(iris)
```

Question: what does `highlight.output = c(TRUE, FALSE)` mean? (Hint: think about R's recycling of vectors)

---

# Some Tips

- To make slides work offline, you need to download a copy of remark.js in advance, because **xaringan** uses the online version by default (see the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader`).

- You can use `xaringan::summon_remark()` to download the latest or a specified version of remark.js. By default, it is downloaded to `libs/remark-latest.min.js`.

- Then change the `chakra` option in YAML to point to this file, e.g.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        chakra: libs/remark-latest.min.js
    ```

- If you used Google fonts in slides (the default theme uses _Yanone Kaffeesatz_, _Droid Serif_, and _Source Code Pro_), they won't work offline unless you download or install them locally. The Heroku app [google-webfonts-helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) can help you download fonts and generate the necessary CSS.

---

# Macros

- remark.js [allows users to define custom macros](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/80) (JS functions) that can be applied to Markdown text using the syntax `![:macroName arg1, arg2, ...]` or `![:macroName arg1, arg2, ...](this)`. For example, before remark.js initializes the slides, you can define a macro named `scale`:

    ```js
    remark.macros.scale = function (percentage) {
      var url = this;
      return '<img src="' + url + '" style="width: ' + percentage + '" />';
    };
    ```

    Then the Markdown text

    ```markdown
    ![:scale 50%](image.jpg)
    ```

    will be translated to
    
    ```html
    <img src="image.jpg" style="width: 50%" />
    ```

---

# Macros (continued)

- To insert macros in **xaringan** slides, you can use the option `beforeInit` under the option `nature`, e.g.,

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          beforeInit: "macros.js"
    ```

    You save your remark.js macros in the file `macros.js`.

- The `beforeInit` option can be used to insert arbitrary JS code before `remark.create()`. Inserting macros is just one of its possible applications.

---

# CSS

Among all options in `xaringan::moon_reader`, the most challenging but perhaps also the most rewarding one is `css`, because it allows you to customize the appearance of your slides using any CSS rules or hacks you know.

You can see the default CSS file [here](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/xaringan/resources/default.css). You can completely replace it with your own CSS files, or define new rules to override the default. See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for more information.

---

# CSS

For example, suppose you want to change the font for code from the default "Source Code Pro" to "Ubuntu Mono". You can create a CSS file named, say, `ubuntu-mono.css`:

```css
@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ubuntu+Mono:400,700,400italic);

.remark-code, .remark-inline-code { font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono'; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "ubuntu-mono.css"]
```

Here I assume `ubuntu-mono.css` is under the same directory as your Rmd.

See [yihui/xaringan#83](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/83) for an example of using the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font, which supports ligatures in program code.

---

# CSS (with Sass)

**xaringan** also supports Sass support via **rmarkdown**. Suppose you want to use the same color for different elements, e.g., first heading and bold text. You can create a `.scss` file, say `mytheme.scss`, using the [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) syntax with variables:

```scss
$mycolor: #ff0000; 
.remark-slide-content > h1 { color: $mycolor; }
.remark-slide-content strong { color: $mycolor; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata using this file placed under the same directory as your Rmd:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "mytheme.scss"]
```

This requires **rmarkdown** >= 2.8 and the [**sass**](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/) package. You can learn more about **rmarkdown** and **sass** support in [this blog post](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/04/15/2021-spring-rmd-news/#sass-and-scss-support-for-html-based-output) and in [**sass** overview vignette](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/articles/sass.html).

---

# Themes

Don't want to learn CSS? Okay, you can use some user-contributed themes. A theme typically consists of two CSS files `foo.css` and `foo-fonts.css`, where `foo` is the theme name. Below are some existing themes:

```{r, R.options=list(width = 70)}
names(xaringan:::list_css())
```

---

# Themes

To use a theme, you can specify the `css` option as an array of CSS filenames (without the `.css` extensions), e.g.,

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: [default, metropolis, metropolis-fonts]
```

If you want to contribute a theme to **xaringan**, please read [this blog post](https://yihui.org/en/2017/10/xaringan-themes).

# Sharingan

The R package name **xaringan** was derived<sup>1</sup> from **Sharingan**, a dōjutsu in the Japanese anime _Naruto_ with two abilities:

- the "Eye of Insight"

- the "Eye of Hypnotism"

I think a presentation is basically a way to communicate insights to the audience, and a great presentation may even "hypnotize" the audience.<sup>2,3</sup>

.footnote[
[1] In Chinese, the pronounciation of _X_ is _Sh_ /ʃ/ (as in _shrimp_). Now you should have a better idea of how to pronounce my last name _Xie_.

[2] By comparison, bad presentations only put the audience to sleep.

[3] Personally I find that setting background images for slides is a killer feature of remark.js. It is an effective way to bring visual impact into your presentations.

# Naruto terminology

The **xaringan** package borrowed a few terms from Naruto, such as

- [Sharingan](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sharingan) (写輪眼; the package name)

- The [moon reader](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Moon_Reader) (月読; an attractive R Markdown output format)

- [Chakra](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Chakra) (查克拉; the path to the remark.js library, which is the power to drive the presentation)

- [Nature transformation](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Nature_Transformation) (性質変化; transform the chakra by setting different options)

- The [infinite moon reader](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_Tsukuyomi) (無限月読; start a local web server to continuously serve your slides)

- The [summoning technique](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Summoning_Technique) (download remark.js from the web)

You can click the links to know more about them if you want. The jutsu "Moon Reader" may seem a little evil, but that does not mean your slides are evil.
